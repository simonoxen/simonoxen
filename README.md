### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a neuroscience PhD candidate working on deep brain stimulation, medical imaging, connectomics, and image guided surgery.

Here is where some of my prjects come to life.

- [Lead-DBS](https://github.com/netstim/leaddbs): My research group develops Lead-DBS, an open-source software for deep brain stimulation electrode localization and analysis which has empowered over 500 studies from groups worldwide. I actively contribute to the project and help users using it.
- [Lead-OR](https://github.com/netstim/SlicerNetstim): Lead-OR is a platform for multi-modal data visualization and processing during deep brain stimulation surgery.
- [SlicerANTs](https://github.com/netstim/SlicerANTs): I integrated the ANTs registration framework into a 3DSlicer module. 
- [WarpDrive](https://github.com/netstim/SlicerNetstim/tree/master/WarpDrive): WarpDrive is a 3DSlicer module that allows ro manually refine displacement fields after non-linear registration.
